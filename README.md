# About the Rock Paper Scissors Project
This Rock Paper Scissors browser game created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

# Rules

1) The game consists of 5 rounds against the computer.

2) For each round, the player must pick either "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

3) The winner of each round is determined by the following criteria:

    - Rock beats scissors
    - Scissors beats paper
    - Paper beats rock

4) The winner of each round earns a point. Draws (when the player and computer pick the same item) earn zero points. 

5) Whoever has the most points at the end of the game, wins.
